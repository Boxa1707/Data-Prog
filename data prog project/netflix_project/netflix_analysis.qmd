## Introduction

Netflix is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world, with a huge collection of movies and TV shows. The goal of this project is to analyze Netflix data and discover trends such as the most popular genres, the distribution of content by release year, and average duration of movies and TV shows.

## Data Presentation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Load Netflix dataset
netflix <- read_csv("data/netflix_titles.csv")

# Show the first 6 rows of the dataset
head(netflix)

# Show the structure of the dataset
glimpse(netflix)
```

## Data Transformation

We perform several transformations to better understand the structure of the dataset and identify key trends.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 1. Count of Movies vs. TV Shows

```{r}
netflix %>%
  count(type)
```

### 2. Number of Titles per Year

```{r}
netflix %>%
  count(release_year) %>%
  arrange(desc(release_year))
```

### 3. Most Common Genres

```{r}
netflix %>%
  separate_rows(listed_in, sep = ", ") %>%
  count(listed_in, sort = TRUE)
```

## Data Visualization

### 1. Barplot: Movies vs. TV Shows

```{r}
netflix %>%
  count(type) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Number of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix",
       x = "Type",
       y = "Count")
```

This bar chart shows that there are significantly more Movies than TV Shows on Netflix.

### 2. Line Chart: Number of Titles per Year

```{r}
netflix %>%
  count(release_year) %>%
  arrange(release_year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = release_year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Number of Netflix Titles Released Per Year",
       x = "Release Year",
       y = "Number of Titles")
```

This line chart shows how the number of Netflix titles released each year has changed. There's a noticeable growth especially after 2015.

### 3. Barplot: Top 10 Most Common Genres

```{r}
netflix %>%
  separate_rows(listed_in, sep = ", ") %>%
  count(listed_in, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(listed_in, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Common Genres on Netflix",
       x = "Genre",
       y = "Count")
```

This horizontal barplot shows the 10 most frequent genres across all Netflix content.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis of the Netflix dataset, we have identified several interesting patterns:

- Movies are more common than TV Shows on the platform.
- There has been a noticeable increase in content production since 2015.
- The most frequent genres are International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies, indicating a global and diverse audience.

These findings reflect Netflixâ€™s strategy to grow its catalog and appeal to a wide international market. The company continues to expand both its original content and licensed titles.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
